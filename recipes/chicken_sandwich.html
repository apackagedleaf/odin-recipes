    <div class ="text"> Chicken </div>
    <ol>
       <li> Add buttermilk, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, sugar, paprika, and cayenne powder; whisk to combine. Add chicken to the buttermilk mixture marinate for at least 20 minutes in the fridge or overnight.</li>

        <li> Take one piece of chicken from the marinade, let the excess drop from it, and toss in the dredge; ensure the chicken is coated in flour and place it on a baking sheet with a rack. Do not pile on top of each other. Repeat with the rest of the chicken.</li>
    
        <li> Fill a cast-iron pan with a neutral oil about halfway full. Using a fry or candy thermometer, heat oil to 350 degrees. Once heated, drop the chicken away from you and fry until golden brown with an internal temperature of 165 degrees. Take the chicken out of the oil into a sheet tray with a rack on top.</li>
